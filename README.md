## Description

This is an app that takes pictures and overlays text to make memes out of friends, family, or pets. Also allows sharing with others via social media or email, and viewing past memes in a table or collection view.

## Purpose

This was an assignment for my iOS degree course at Udacity.  The purpose of this app was to further familiarity with passing information between view controllers, using autolayout, accessing the camera, and various other things.

## Feature Wish List

This app was written while I was an even bigger newbie than I am now.  The entire code should probably be mostly re-written.  In addition there are several features I would like to eventually add to this app:

- Social media integration
- Data persistence
